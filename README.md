Online programming assessment

I developed this online programming assessment system using C#.Net, Winforms, ASP.NET and Mysql database. User can program in languages like C, C++, C#, Java and see its output in command line. It contains every functionality requied to create questions, assign to a candidate, view result and generate report. It also comes with other features like webcam capture, task monitoring etc.
